Provides the functionality to mint agent `components` and canonical `agents` via the ERC721 standard.
It stores instances associated with components and agents, supplies a set of read-only functions to inquire the state
of entities.

The protocol also provides the capability of creating `services` that are based on canonical agents. Each service
instance bears a set of canonical agent Ids it is composed of with the number of agent instances for each Id. For the
service deployment `operators` supply agent instances to a specific service via registration. Once all the required
agent instances are provided by operators, the service can be deployed forming a Gnosis Safe contract governed by
a group of agent instances.
